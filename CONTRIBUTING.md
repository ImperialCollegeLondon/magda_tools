First of all thanks for thinking about contributing!

Just a few simple guidelines:
1. Ensure your code is formatted according to the black code style and
   does not generate any errors with flake8.
2. Use type annotations and check that there are no errors with mypy.
3. Make sure any new functionality is accompanied by appropriate tests.
4. Carry out development in a new branch and create pull requests
   against the develop branch of magda_tools.
