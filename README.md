# MAGDA Processing Library

Routines used by the Cassini-Huygens Magnetometer Data Archive (MAGDA)
for data processing and plotting that may be of general use for
working with MAGDA data in flat file format.

This package implements:
1. A class for reading Magda data files in flat file (ffd) format
2. Routines for calculating a handful of spacecraft position
   properties with respect to Saturn
3. An implementation of an arbitrary order B-field spherical harmonic
   expansion model

# Examples

Some simple scripts demonstrating the capabilities of the library are
provided in the examples directory. These additionally require
matplotlib to be installed.
