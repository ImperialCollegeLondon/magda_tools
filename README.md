# MAGDA Processing Library

Routines used by the Cassini-Huygens Magnetometer Data Archive (MAGDA)
for data processing and plotting that may be of general use for
working with MAGDA data in flat file format.

# Examples

Some simple scripts demonstrating the capabilities of the library are
provided in the examples directory. These additionally require
matplotlib to be installed.
